# About

Iâ€™m currently a software engineer on the Platform Team at [Nylas](https://nylas.com). Our team powers the next generation of APIs that will soon become the default way businesses manage communication data across email, calendars, and contacts. 

Previously, I worked under [Bhaskar Ghosh](https://www.8vc.com/team/bhaskar-ghosh) at [8VC](https://www.8vc.com/), a venture capital firm that invests in ambitious technology platforms that seek to transform industries. 

On the side, I enjoy building and testing my own projects; I'm currently exploring 1) the visionOS SDKs and 2) leveraging LLMs for language learning.

I was born in Worcester, MA, spent my early childhood in Orange, CT, and then grew up in Alpharetta, GA from the age of ten onwards. After high school, I attended the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) where I graduated with an undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science.

Outside of work, some of my hobbies include longboarding, snowboarding, lifting, travel, and going to concerts! Most recently, I had the opportunity to obtain my Open Water Diver certification in [Jupiter, FL](https://jupiterdivecenter.com/).
