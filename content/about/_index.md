# Hello!

My name is Omkar Waingankar, and I'm a software engineer based in NYC. I'm currently employed at [Nylas](https://nylas.com), a Series C SaaS startup focused on simplifying the developer experience around email / communication data, and I specifically build APIs and event-driven microservices in Go to support our latest machine learning / analytic offerings.

Prior to Nylas, I was an intern on the investment team at the Silicon Valley venture capital firm, [8VC](https://www.8vc.com/). I spoke with founders building B2B SaaS products in spaces spanning sales enablement, databases, kubernetes / devops, travel, ML feature stores, and more under the mentorship of 8VC Partner [Bhaskar Ghosh](https://www.8vc.com/team/bhaskar-ghosh).

In college, I started [Flipout](https://flipout.io), a free-to-play sports betting platform, and got my first taste of iterating on a product, forming partnerships with other business, raising venture funds, and immersing myself in the Bay Area's tech entrepreneurship scene. I've been passionate about startups ever since that transformative experience! Today, I'm most excited about the potential of [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/), an upcoming industry standard in observability, and [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/), a new binary compilation target that runs at blazingly fast speeds.

I was born in Worcester, MA, spent my early childhood in Orange, CT, and then grew up in Alpharetta, GA from the age of ten onwards. After high school, I attended the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) where I graduated with an undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering & Computer Science.

Outside of work, some of my hobbies include skateboarding/snowboarding, lifting, travel, and going to concerts! Most recently, I had the opportunity to obtain my Open Water Diver certification in [Jupiter, FL](https://jupiterdivecenter.com/).
